### Don't get confused on envoy logs

When running envoy with config generated by the service, don't get confused by the message:
``` 
[info][lua] [source/extensions/filters/http/lua/lua_filter.cc:189] envoy_on_response() function not found. Lua filter will not hook responses.
```
This is expected and intended behaviour. The ```envoy_on_response``` function is optional for lua-filters and allows to add response filtering. 
But since the filter is targeting requests(e.g. ```envoy_on_request```) it ignores responses and does not implement such method.
